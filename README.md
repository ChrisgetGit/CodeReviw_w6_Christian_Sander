    (25 points) Use 4 steps for database development process - ensure that your database is in 3rd Normal Form. Ensure 
    that all elements given as bold in the task description (Task description: Mail Delivery Service) are covered in 
    your database design. (hint: use draw.io tool, but try to draw the delivery process first on a paper before creating
    any diagrams in digital form). Please save your diagram(s) as pdf files  in one folder and upload this folder to the
    project database to GitHub.

    (45 points) Recreate your database design in MySQL. Name your database as delivery_john_doe (use your name instead of
    "john" and "doe"). Export your database as delivery_john_doe.sql dump file and then upload the .sql file with the project 
    to GitHub.

    (10 points) Insert test data into the database (insert some dummy data in your database, at least 3 sets of data per table)

    (20 points) Create at least 6 different SQL queries to show the power of your database (save these queries to delivery_queries.sql
    file and upload it to the project) Note: The use of JOINS is required for at least two queries). These queries should show
    similar results to:  how many packages/mail were sent from this specific city, who sent packages/mail on this date, who sent 
    packages/mail between this and that date, etc.
